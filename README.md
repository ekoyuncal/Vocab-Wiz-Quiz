# Vocab-Wiz-Quiz

"Word Wiz Quiz" is a fun little project I created whenever I found myself getting bored while studying English vocabulary. It's a quiz game designed to spice up your vocabulary practice sessions with a bit of excitement and challenge. Test your word wizardry and see how many words you can conquer!

## Features
The program offers two modes:

1. **Word Entry Mode:** Allows users to save their own list of words.
2. **Quiz Mode:** Enables users to test their vocabulary knowledge through interactive quizzes.

If you wish to utilize your custom word lists, simply place them in the same directory as the executable code. In the near future, I plan to add a feature for opening and utilizing predefined word lists from within the program interface. Stay tuned for updates!
